- 👋 Hi, I’m Travas Young @kobayashi-maru
- 👀 I’m interested in open source solutions to visuall analytics for robotics, people detection, pose detection, etc. I've been fortunate to do some consultation work for American Sign Language linguistics and ASL interpreter training technologies, and I'm interested in future ASL collaborations.
- 🌱 I'm currently working as a DevOps project manager and a junior programer (javascript, css, html, and python). I'm particularly interested in video analytics via systems like YOLO. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video annotation approaches using open source solutions
- 📫 Reach me by email at travas dot young at try dash synergy dot com
